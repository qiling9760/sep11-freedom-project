## Context 
I created a game where the player can interact with the character of the game using their keyboard to move the character around. In the game, the player need to collect as many points as they can in 1 minute and carefully avoid the enemy that will end the game immediately. I created a slideshow with my partner and present it to my class. I also presented my project in the exposition to the judges and students. 

## Takeaways from in-class presentation
My partner and I presented our project to our classmate. We need to create a [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1olx8nXpbPYpAoqYAZu7unVwbOQGKHad8MgL73iy6Uzg/edit?usp=sharing) to explain our process in making the game. 

First, we need a hook in our presentation to attract the audience. We should make our hook simple and not with paragraphs. A question or statement is the best. 

Second, we should only pick out the most important code of our game to put on the slides because we need to keep our presentation between 5-10 minutes. We cannot have paragraphs of explanation aside with the code, instead, we should use bullet points to summarize it. When giving the presentation, we should look at the audience rather than read directly from the slides. We should make eye contact with all of the audience. In addition, we should talk clearly, slowly, and loudly to make sure everyone can hear us and understand what we are talking about. We can also point at the board with our finger or the mouse to point out which part of the code we are talking about. 

Lastly, we should summarize our game and share the takeways and challenges we have while creating the game. We should not forget to say "Thank You" at the end of our presentation to show the audience that we are done.
