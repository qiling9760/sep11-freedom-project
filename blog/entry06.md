# Entry 6
##### 6/1/25

## Context 
I created a game where the player can interact with the character of the game using their keyboard to move the character around. In the game, the player need to collect as many points as they can in 1 minute and carefully avoid the enemy that will end the game immediately. I created a slideshow with my partner and present it to my class. I also presented my project in the exposition to the judges and students. 

## Takeaways from in-class presentation
My partner and I presented our project to our classmate. We need to create a [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1olx8nXpbPYpAoqYAZu7unVwbOQGKHad8MgL73iy6Uzg/edit?usp=sharing) to explain our process in making the game. 

First, we need a hook in our presentation to attract the audience. We should make our hook simple and not with paragraphs. A question or statement is the best. 

Second, we should only pick out the most important code of our game to put on the slides because we need to keep our presentation between 5-10 minutes. We cannot have paragraphs of explanation aside with the code, instead, we should use bullet points to summarize it. When giving the presentation, we should look at the audience rather than read directly from the slides. We should make eye contact with all of the audience. In addition, we should talk clearly, slowly, and loudly to make sure everyone can hear us and understand what we are talking about. We can also point at the board with our finger or the mouse to point out which part of the code we are talking about. 

Lastly, we should summarize our game and share the takeways and challenges we have while creating the game. We should not forget to say "Thank You" at the end of our presentation to show the audience that we are done. 

## Takeaways from giving Expo elevator pitch
We need to present our game in the exposition and create an [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1exF717Far0E5xbauY579foVsBIblgttGaAHf2wxP_Nk/edit?usp=sharing) within 1 minute to explain our game. 

Before making the elevator pitch, we need to decide what we should say and who should say what. After discussions, we decided that our pitch will focus on the most important feature of our game, which is the cat collect the cat food. My partner will take the part of introducing our game, and I will take the part of explaining our game. 

We should memorize our pitch and know what we need to present when we are saying our pitch. For example, when my partner introduce our game, we should open our game and show them how to play. When I am explaining the game, I should show them the code. 

It is also important that I need to change my pitch when presenting to different people. For example, when someone who come by is a person who took the computer science class before, I can shorten my part of explaining the code because they knew what they mean. If the person who I present to do not know about coding, I may need to explaining the code more easy to understand. 

## Skills 
### Communication 
While making the presentation and elevator pitch, my partner and I need to divide the task. We talked about what should be include in our slides, and who should present what part. We need to communicate and come to an agreement. 

### Leadership
I took the lead when making the presentation. I told my partner what code we should show to our class and decided what time we meet up to make the slideshow. I also answered the audience's questions after the presentation.
