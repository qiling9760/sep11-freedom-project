# Entry 1: Collect Cat Food Game
##### 11/3/24

## My Game
For this year's Freedom Project, I decided to work with my friends to create a game about spending cat food to obtain different rarity of cats by chance. We separated the game into two parts, and we split into two teams to create each part. After we finish with our part of the game, we will combine them together at the end of our Freedom Project.

In **Part A**, the user will control a cat to move around a 2D tile map to collect cat food. The cat food will randomly appear on the map, and the user will control the cat using keyboard keys to get the cat food. Once the user get that cat food, another cat food will appear on the map in a different location. There are boosts on the map that help the user get the cat food, and obstacles that make the game harder.

In **Part B**, the user will use the cat food they collected to obtain cats. There will be a gunball like machine that gives out a cat once the user insert the amount of cat food needed. There are 15 cats in total, and these cats are divided into three rarities. The probability to obtain a rarity of cat is different- *Rare* cats: 75%, *Super Rare* cats: 20%, *Super Super Rare* cats: 5%. There is a chance for the user to obtain the same cat more than once. However, if the user pulls up to 50 tries and did not get any SSR cat, they are guaranteed to get a random SSR cat.
