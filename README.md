# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Qilin Guo**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Kaboom** in order to help me make **an interactive game where the player can control the character to collect points using their keyboard**.

## Content
My blogs show the process of me learning the tool Kaboom. They show what skills I have learned over the year to make my freedom project. In my blogs, I included every functions that I learned from Kaboom and all the challenges I faced when learning them.
